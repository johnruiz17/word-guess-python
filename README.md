## Word Guessing Game
This console-based game challenges the player to guess a randomly selected word. The program displays a series of underscores representing the word's length. The player inputs letters one at a time. Correct guesses replace the corresponding underscores; incorrect guesses decrease the number of allowed attempts. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the entire word or runs out of attempts.
